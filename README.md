# FreedomUnitCalculator

Freedom Unit Calculator.  A silly python terminal based program to take common distance measurements and convert it to how many average burger heights it would take, when stacked vertically, to cover that distance.

How to run: run the python script, select imperial or metric, the speciifc measurment within that, enter the number and then bing bing bong, the result!
